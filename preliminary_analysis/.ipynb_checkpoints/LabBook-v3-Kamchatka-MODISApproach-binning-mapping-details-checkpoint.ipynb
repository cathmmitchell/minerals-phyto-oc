    "\n",
    "The format of the binned files is slightly weird, and not well explained anywhere. From forum reading,  I learnt that you can't open them in SeaDAS and opening them in HDFView or a notebook didn't really help me detangle what was inside. Therefore, I decided to try one of the mapping processors: `l2mapgen`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful and easy to use/interpret, but data is only output in image format. I need to use `l3mapgen`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run 3\n",
    "\n",
    "There were a lot of gaps in the data when producing a mapped file at 1km resolution. This is because the resolution is really only 1km at nadir, and when you move further from nadir the pixels are larger. Therefore the binning results in these gaps. Going to try binning at a larger resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run 4\n",
    "\n",
    "This didn't really improve things much. But I did more reading on the forum and learnt that (https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/forum/oceancolor/topic_show.pl?pid=40924#pid40924):\n",
    ">By default,  mapper (l3mapgen) takes each mapped pixel and looks up in the bin file the closest bin to the mapped pixel center, so mapping a 1km\n",
    "bin file of a nominally 1km sensor to a 1km map resolution will produce some pretty Moire patterns.  The mapper has two features to help mitigate this:\n",
    "fudge and interp.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The fudge factor, is just that.  It \"fudges\" the size of the area to look up in the bin file by the corresponding factor provided.  When the mapper looks up\n",
    "a location in the bin file and does not find a match, you get missing data in the map.  With the fudge factor, the mapper will look up a larger region in the\n",
    "bin file to associate with the map pixel.  The current version only does this look up if no retrieval was found using the defined resolution. \n",
    "\n",
    ">The interp option allows you to select 'area' (the default is nearest-neighbor, so no interpolation).  With area interpolation, the mapper uses the corners of\n",
    "the mapped pixel to define an area to search in the bin file.  This is a useful feature, since the projection of the map is not going to line up with the projection\n",
    "of the bin file.\n",

    "### Run 5\n",
    "\n",
    "This helped, and there are less gaps in the data. However, I noticed there are some regions in the chl data that appear to be missing where there was valid data in the L2 file. Is there a flagging issue? I can't specify the flags in `l3mapgen` - I assume they are just taking them from the L3b file (which were specified using `l2bin`). The forum tells me:\n",
    ">Be aware that when you specify l3bprod=\"all\" you are binning everything from the level2 file.  The way binning works is that for any one pixel, if any one product fails to bin for that pixel, then all products fail to bin for that pixel.  For example: if you want your rhos_nnn bands to bin over land you cannot also bin Rrs_nnn together with them because Rrs_nnn band do not contain values over land.\n",
