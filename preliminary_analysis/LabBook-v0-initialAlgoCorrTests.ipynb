    "I want to test how the different algorithm correction methods perform when there is volcanic ash present. My understanding is that volcanic ash, as a strongly absorbing aerosol, will be incorrectly dealt with in the default NASA OBPG processing stream, and that I should use something like Wang and Shi 2007. So, I want to check the performance for a couple of satellite images where there are known ash events and see the difference between the default algorithm and the SWIR/NIR algorithm.\n",

    "    1. An IOCCG report states that even though the magnitudes of Rrs will be too low, the ratio of blue to green will be the same, therefore the OC4/OC3M flavour of chl algorithms will be OK, but the OCI flavour will not.\n",

The standard (and non-standard) algorithms detect aerosols based on the signal in the NIR, but unfortunately, using the NIR it is not possible to distinguish if there is a strongly absorbing aerosol or not. A LUT is used to select an aerosol based on the NIR signal and 80 commonly occurring aerosols. \n",
